## Workforce Insights: Translating Employee Data into Scalable People Solutions R

The goal of this notebook is to identify the predictors of increase in employee turnover rates and decrease in sales at a IndyFair Donuts, a hypothetical Food and Beverage Company. First, I clean and explore the dataset to prepare it for subsequent analyses. After reviewing the organization's demographic and performance characteristics through Explorator Data Analysis, I generate two logistic regression models that predict increase in employee turnover rates and decrease in sales of donuts. The first regression model takes a large set of predictors while the second model includes only seven.

Finally, after model validation, I explore the business case for possible HR intervention strategies. Discussion on intervention strategy and ROI estimates draw on recent research in HR and management journals around the cost of employee turnover.
